1.find stimuli with longest pre_stim time for each subject
	timestamp for every neuron for the stimuli is made into an input 
	timestamp --> detect burst -- 9 parameters

		--> (460,9) matrix

2. Clustering + Reduction of Dimensionality
	pick out subject 070921 to see its involvement


3. Put cluster result labels back to data and check if features of datapoints with different labels also differ by some patterns



now to do list:

collect deleted samples (with no burst) and plot them in barplot (probably they belong to the LN class -- regular firing) -- surprise should also be related to bursts, so if theres no burst theres no surprise plottable
check whether samples in the same neuron always have either all have burst or no burst at all
no need to use argMaxPreStim

we have 23 stimuli and 5 run for each stimuli (for each neuron for each moth num)
