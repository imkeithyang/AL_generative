1.find stimuli with longest pre_stim time for each subject
	timestamp for every neuron for the stimuli is made into an input 
	timestamp --> detect burst -- 9 parameters

		--> (460,9) matrix

2. Clustering + Reduction of Dimensionality
	pick out subject 070921 to see its involvement


3. Put cluster result labels back to data and check if features of datapoints with different labels also differ by some patterns



now to do list:

Utils/get_data.py make_spiketrain() --> turn timestamp into vector (1 represents spike)
Utils/plot.py plot_spike()

plot spike train (0,1,no burst)

Variational auto encoder (VAE) --> extract hidden output (with reduced dimensionality, but not directly to 2 -- we can reduce that later for visualization) and do clustering with it --> draw barplot


we have 23 stimuli and 5 run for each stimuli (for each neuron for each moth num)
