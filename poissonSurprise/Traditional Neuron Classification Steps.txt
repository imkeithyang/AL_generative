1.find stimuli with longest pre_stim time for each subject
	timestamp for every neuron for the stimuli is made into an input 
	timestamp --> detect burst -- 9 parameters

		--> (460,9) matrix

2. Clustering + Reduction of Dimensionality
	pick out subject 070921 to see its involvement


3. Put cluster result labels back to data and check if features of datapoints with different labels also differ by some patterns
